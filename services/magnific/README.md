# Magnific service (web-API wrapper)

Wraps the **Magnific** (formerly Freepik) web-UI generation API as psflow graphs, exposed over MCP as `magnific.generate`, `magnific.list_models`, and `magnific.history`. Personal, single-user, solo-maintained.

Spec: `ergon/active-documents/20260530-132304-Web-API-Wrapper-Spec.md`.

Status: **recon essentially complete** — captured via Playwright (network interceptor) against an authenticated session. The full generate flow, endpoints, auth model, WebSocket channel, and result-URL linkage are confirmed below. Only the exact WS completion *event name/payload* is still unconfirmed (§6). Captured payloads live in `fixtures/recon/`.

## 1. Backend shape (confirmed)

Base: `https://www.magnific.com/app/api/`. The browser app is at `/app`; the image generator is `/app/ai-image-generator` (internally "Pikaso").

| Operation | Method + path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| list_models | `GET /app/api/v2/ai-models?lang=en_US` | Array of ~140 models across tools; `tool="text-to-image"` are the image models (~44: auto, mystic*, flux*, imagen*, seedream*, ideogram, nano-banana, gpt*, recraft, reve, qwen, krea, grok, z-image). Each: `{id, slug, tool, status, inputs{prompt,aspectRatio,numberOfImages,...}, metadata, credits{min,max}}`. |
| history | `GET /app/api/projects/files/recent?page=&per_page=&order_by=created_at` | `{data[], meta}`. Each item: `download_url`, `thumbnail{url,w,h}`, `creation.metadata.prompt`, `created_at`, `tool_name`. |
| cost preview | `POST /app/api/v2/ai/simulate-generation` | Body `{items:[{model,quantity,config:{resolution,numberOfImages}}],forceCredits:true}` → per-item + total credit cost and remaining. Optional pre-flight. |
| generate — start | `POST /app/api/start-tti-v2` | Body `{mode:<model-slug>, prompt, references:[], num_images, aspect_ratio, variations, force_credits:true}` → `{family:<uuid>, request_tokens:[...], available_slots, limit}`. Reserves a generation family + a token per image. |
| generate — render (×N) | `POST https://ak-data.magnific.com/app/api/render/v4` | One call per image. Body `{tool:"text-to-image", mode, family, prompt, width, height, seed, aspect_ratio, resolution, request_token, image_index, num_images, ...}` → `{creation:{id, identifier, family, metadata{seed, expectTime, creditLedger,...}}}`. **`creation.id` keys the result URL.** Note the separate host `ak-data.magnific.com`. |
| completion | **WebSocket (self-hosted Pusher, protocol 7)** | `wss://ak-data.magnific.com/app/app/xzo0bvj9t7raco6og0q3?protocol=7&client=js&version=8.4.0`. Per-user private channel **`private-user.{id}`**, authorized by `POST /app/broadcasting/auth` (req body `socket_id=…&channel_name=private-user.{id}`; resp `{auth:"<key>:<hmac>"}`). Handshake: connect → `pusher:connection_established` (`data.socket_id`) → broadcasting/auth → `pusher:subscribe`. Completion pushed per `creation` — **not** polling. |
| result images | `https://pikaso.cdnpk.net/private/production/{creation.id}/render.{jpg|png}?token=exp=...~hmac=...` | Signed, time-limited CDN URLs, keyed by `creation.id` from the render call. Download with psflow `http`+`body_sink`. |

## 2. Auth (confirmed)

Session **cookie** plus an **`x-xsrf-token`** request header (Laravel). The header value is the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie's value, echoed back per request. State-changing POSTs (generate) require it; the app also sends `x-request-origin` and `x-folder-reference`.

**psflow gap #1 — RESOLVED.** `cookie_jar` now echoes a cookie into a request header via `params.csrf_cookie` + `params.csrf_header` (URL-decoded by default). The graphs declare `csrf_cookie: XSRF-TOKEN`, `csrf_header: x-xsrf-token`. See the annotation reference's `cookie_jar` section.

Cookies are seeded once from a manual browser login via the export helper (planned). No refresh — on expiry, generation fails and you re-login.

## 3. Completion is WebSocket, not polling

The earlier spec decision defaulted to polling. **For Magnific the real mechanism is a Pusher WebSocket.** The client subscribes to the per-user channel `private-user.{id}` (authorized via `POST /app/broadcasting/auth`); completion is pushed per `creation`. So `generate` is: `start-tti-v2` → fan-out `render/v4` per image (each yields a `creation.id`) → `websocket_subscribe` waiting for the completion event(s) matching those `creation.id`s → download each signed `pikaso.cdnpk.net/.../{creation.id}/render.{ext}`. `poll_until` is not used (the `check_status` subgraph stub was removed). The channel is per-user, not per-job, so the graph must correlate WS events to its own `creation.id`s.

## 4. Credits

The recon account is Premium+ with effectively unlimited image generation, so credit spend is not a practical constraint for this wrapper.

## 5. Fixtures captured

- `fixtures/recon/ai-models.json` — full model catalog (list_models response).
- `fixtures/recon/files-recent.json` — history response (`projects/files/recent`).
- `fixtures/recon/simulate-generation-response.json` — cost-preview response.
- `fixtures/recon/start-tti-v2-response.json` — generate-start response (`family`, `request_tokens`).
- `fixtures/recon/render-v4-response.json` — per-image render response (`creation.id`, metadata).
- `fixtures/recon/auto-mode-constraints-video.json` — the `video/generate/auto` constraints descriptor (captured while pinning the submit pattern; video, not image).

## 6. psflow gaps + remaining work

**Gap #1 (cookie → header CSRF echo) — DONE.** `cookie_jar` now supports `csrf_cookie`/`csrf_header` (§2).

**Gap #2 (reactive WS handshake) — DONE.** The `ws` handler now supports `config.handshake`: on a triggering frame it optionally calls an auth endpoint (with the node's auth strategy, e.g. cookie_jar+CSRF) and sends a computed frame. That expresses the Pusher subscribe (connect → `pusher:connection_established` → `POST /broadcasting/auth` → `pusher:subscribe`). `generate.mmd`'s WAIT node uses it. See the annotation reference's `ws` → `handshake` section; covered by a mock-WS + mock-HTTP integration test.

**`generate.mmd` structure — authored.** Full flow: `start-tti-v2` → build channel → render fan-out (`loop:` ForEach over `request_tokens`, with an `accumulator` collecting `creation.id`s — sequential so the shared blackboard aggregates) → `ws` handshake wait → build URLs → download fan-out (`parallel-loop`). The graph parses (`--validate`).

**Data-threading finding (the real remaining dependency).** Both loops read their collection from the **blackboard by key**, and cross-cutting values (`channel`, `family`, `prompt`, `user_id`) need to reach nodes *past* intermediate steps. The raw psflow executor has **no generic "publish a node-output to the blackboard" handler** — `rhai` can read `ctx` but not write it; only `accumulator` writes (incrementally). This is fine under the intended host: **Ergon promotes step results to the blackboard**, so the loop collections and cross-cutting values resolve there. It only bites a standalone raw-executor run.

Remaining:

- [ ] **Confirm Ergon's step-promotion key syntax** and point `exec.loop_foreach` (`request_tokens`, `image_urls`) and the WAIT `channel` at the promoted keys. (Standalone alternative: add a small `set`-blackboard handler — candidate gap #3.)
- [ ] Capture the exact **completion event** name/payload on `private-user.{id}` to fill the WAIT `terminate` predicate (whether the signed URL is in the frame or built from `creation.id`).
- [ ] Fill the `render/v4` body details (width/height/seed/resolution per model) and the `creation.id` → signed-URL assembly.

## 7. Host / MCP exposure

psflow is the **engine**; **Ergon is the host** that exposes graphs (the `psflow-manifest` binary feeds "Ergon's MCP handler catalogue", and Ergon runs psflow-annotated `.mmd` graphs via `workflow_run name=… inputs=…`). So MCP exposure is registering these graphs with Ergon, not a psflow-native server.

Host-side Rust wiring (per `docs/host-integration-quickstart.md`) is mostly automatic:
- `ExecutionContext` + a `SecretResolver` that supplies the Magnific session cookie (seeded by the cookie-export helper).
- `auto_install_auth_registry(&graph, &ctx)` — builds the `cookie_jar` (with CSRF echo) strategy from the graph's `auth.*` declarations.
- `NodeRegistry::with_defaults_full(engine, ctx)` — the context-bound `http`/`ws` handlers so `config.auth` resolves.
- `TopologicalExecutor::execute(&graph, &handlers)`.

Notably, the `generate` graph uses only `ws` + the `parallel-loop:` directive — **no `poll_until`/named subgraph** — so it needs **no graph library** registered on the host. Remaining host-side work: the cookie `SecretResolver`, and registering the three graphs as Ergon workflows/tools (`magnific.*`); MCP param schemas derive from each graph's declared input ports.

## 8. Spec corrections captured here

- **Product is Magnific/Pikaso, not Freepik** — rebrand; domain `magnific.com`.
- **Completion is WebSocket**, not polling (§3).
- **Auth needs cookie + `x-xsrf-token`**, which exceeds the built-in `cookie_jar` (§2).
- Auth is graph-level annotations, not an `auth.yaml`.
- `file_output` is `http`+`body_sink` over the signed CDN URL.
- Fan-out over result images is a `parallel-loop:` subgraph.
